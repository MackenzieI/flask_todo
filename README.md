# Flask Todo App

## Description

Web application built in the Fall 2023 semester during my study abroad semester in Southern Germany, which implements a basic todo app. The application is built with Python, the Python microframework Flask, and uses a MongoDB database.

Users can type a task and it will be displayed in a list below. Users can mark a task as done and/or delete it afterwards. There is a defunct update/edit function.

The app is used in a docker and minikube environment. It can run on multiple ports.

## How to Run

Run locally:

You will need to have the third party assets installed. Load the images for Mongo and the Flask app then run it using minikube.

## Credits

This was a solo project. Third-party assets are MongoDB, Flask, Docker, Minikube, and Helmchart.
